// A git tool call must be interruptible.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// --------------------
// `git.js` used `runGit`, which is `spawnSync`. That BLOCKS the event loop for the whole command,
// and an AbortSignal cannot fire while the loop is held — measured, `spawnSync` accepts a `signal`
// option and ignores it, waiting out the full timeout.
//
// So while `git log` ran on a large history the TUI was frozen and Esc did nothing, because the
// keypress could not even be read. The log and diff paths allowed 120s, which made that a
// two-minute freeze in the worst case. The tool now calls `runGitAsync` with the turn's signal.
