// The capability probe's PARSER and its protocol.
//
// WHY A PARSER TEST AND NOT JUST THE HARNESS
// ------------------------------------------
// The end-to-end harness (tools/check_term_probe.mjs, driven by
// test/term-probe-e2e.test.mjs) is what proves the wiring, but it only ever feeds it
// the handful of replies one terminal emits. The parser is the part that has to be
// right about every shape a reply can take — four hex digits vs two, BEL vs ST, a
// reply split across TCP-sized reads, a keystroke arriving in the middle of one — so
// it is tested directly here. The protocol side (what gets written, and that keystrokes
// are never eaten) is covered by the sibling file, which drives the real module
// against streams.
