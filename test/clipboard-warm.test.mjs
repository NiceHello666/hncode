// The first clipboard paste after startup must return what is ON THE CLIPBOARD.
//
// THE BUG THIS PINS
// -----------------
// The warm sequence writes a sentinel to the helper shell so the assembly load is
// distinguishable from a command answer. It used to be written WITHOUT a queued
// resolver ("so it drains from the buffer"), on the assumption that nothing else
// could be in flight yet. A read that arrived before that sentinel came back put its
// resolver in the queue first, so the SENTINEL consumed the READ's slot and resolved
// it with its own empty output: the paste said "Clipboard empty or unavailable", the
// real answer arrived afterwards with nobody left to receive it, and `helperBusy` was
// cleared while the probe was still running. Reproduced before the fix — the read got
// "", and the payload was dropped.
//
// The failure needs a REAL PowerShell (it is about sentinel ordering on a live pipe),
// so this test builds the same protocol against the same shell. It SKIPS when the
// shell cannot be started, rather than reporting a pass it did not earn.
