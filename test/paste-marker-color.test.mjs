// A styled span must not end with a bare reset when text follows it.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// --------------------
// `ESC[0m` clears EVERY style. When a chip — a `[paste #N …]` marker, a `**bold**` run — ends with
// one and more text follows, that text loses the foreground its caller had set and falls back to the
// terminal default. The comment above `inlineMarkdown` records the bold case happening for real:
// "plain text after a **bold** run used to lose its colour and fall back to the terminal default".
//
// `highlightPasteMarkers` had the same defect and was missed by that earlier fix: the row read
// `… ESC[48;5;23m [paste #1 +12 lines] ESC[0m and then normal text`, so the tail of the composer
// line came out grey instead of the prompt's colour.
