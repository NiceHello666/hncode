// The TUI must ACT on what the terminal says.
//
//   node tools/check_term_probe.mjs <friendly|hostile|light|silent|typing>
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// `src/term-caps.js` has parser unit tests and `term-caps.test.mjs` passes whether or
// not the TUI does anything with the result. The entire value of asking the terminal is
// in the wiring — the synchronized-output wrapper, the Kitty keyboard sequence, and the
// theme that has to match the terminal's background — so this runs the real startup
// against a scripted terminal that answers the queries, then reads back what was
// actually written to stdout.
//
// ONE SCENARIO PER PROCESS. `term-caps.js` holds the detected capabilities in module
// state, and `startTUI` arms timers, takes raw mode and installs stdin handlers; a
// second run in one process would be measuring leftovers from the first.
