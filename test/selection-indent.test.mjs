// Selecting a chat row must not include its left margin.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// --------------------
// Every chat row is drawn with one column of left margin — the `PAD` the renderer prepends — so a drag
// that begins at the left edge of the text paints that space too. Copying a reply then puts a leading
// space on the clipboard, on every line of a multi-paragraph answer.
//
// THE RULE IS ONE COLUMN, ALWAYS. An earlier attempt measured a per-row "indent width" and skipped all
// of it: a tool row's ` ● ` bullet, a user box's `│ ❯ ` wall. That was wrong, and the tests below say so.
// Those columns are part of what the row DRAWS, and a selection beginning on one of them is a selection
// the user made deliberately. The margin is different only because it is not content at all — so the
// rule is "column 0 is never selection", applied to every row whatever sits there.
