// The travelling light on the Working row and the Using row.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// --------------------
// Both rows used to run a four-phase colour pulse whose band was HALF THE ROW WIDE. Every character
// kept the new colour after the band passed, so the phrase swung between orange and yellow and then
// between orange and red — a slow breathing, not a movement, and the red half read as an error state
// on a row that only means "working".
//
// The replacement is a light that PASSES: it runs left to right, and a character returns to its base
// colour once the light has left it.
//
// Three numbers are tied together, and getting any one wrong produces an animation that looks
// plausible and behaves wrongly:
//
//   the light width    a quarter of the row, rounded DOWN — 2 characters for `Working...`
//   the light shape    a raised cosine reaching 0 at both ends, so it fades in and out
//   the light speed    milliseconds PER CHARACTER, chosen so a frame advances exactly one
//                      character, which is the smoothest a 30fps tick can be
//
// The speed is stated in milliseconds rather than in frames of the spinner tick, and that is
// load-bearing: the spinner advances every 80ms while the render path redraws at 33ms, so a phase
// taken from the spinner would step in 80ms jumps however often it redrew.
