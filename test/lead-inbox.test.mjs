// The lead's inbox: how a teammate reaches the agent that commands the team.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// --------------------
// A team of four came back as a lead with no members and five unread messages nobody had ever
// opened. Separate defects produced that:
//
//   1. NOTHING READ THE LEAD'S INBOX. Teammates drain their own box through `waitForMail`; the
//      lead had no reader at all, and `formatRoster` hardcoded its unread count to 0. So a
//      member asking "what should I work on?" wrote into a file nobody opened.
//   2. A FINISHED TEAMMATE WAS REMOVED FROM THE ROSTER, taking its inbox with it
//      (`removeTeammate` clears the mailbox). A member that had reported in and was waiting for
//      work vanished, along with everything it had said.
//   3. The idle timeout made a member quit after two quiet minutes, so a later instruction
//      arrived with nobody there to receive it.
//
// A FOURTH, SELF-INFLICTED DEFECT SHAPES THE TESTS BELOW.
// A first fix for (1) decided "the lead" must be the user, filtered the inbox down to messages
// from non-lead senders, and refused to send TO the lead. That broke the one thing the user
// wanted — commanding the team — and it was a misreading: `lead` is a ROLE on a real agent
// record. See "the lead is a rostered member with its own inbox, not the user".
//
// ROSTER FACTS THIS FILE RELIES ON (both are the real, documented behaviour):
//   * `createTeam` leaves the roster EMPTY on purpose.
//   * `addMember` makes the FIRST member added the lead, overwriting any `leadName` passed to
//     `createTeam`. So `/team create` + `/team add` is what puts a lead on the roster, and the
//     lead's roster name is not the fixed `team-lead` alias.
