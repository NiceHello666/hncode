// The shared row cache: bounded by USE, keyed by CONTENT.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// The TUI cached rendered rows on the message objects, and evicted by POSITION:
// `CACHE_KEEP` counted messages from the tail. So a long session discarded the caches of
// its oldest thousands while keeping the most recent 300 however small they were — the
// bound tracked messages, not memory — and scrolling back re-rendered everything from
// scratch. It also could not survive a session switch, because the message objects it
// lived on are thrown away and rebuilt from the log, so every `--continue` and every
// `/sessions` resume started cold.
//
// Two things have to hold for the replacement to be better, and both are pinned here:
//
//   1. Eviction is by USE. The entries worth keeping are the ones being read, not the ones
//      written most recently — a FIFO would evict the message you are looking at.
//   2. The key covers every layout input. A key that missed one would serve rows drawn
//      for a different width or a different toggle, which is a MIS-DRAWN frame rather than
//      a stale one — a much worse failure, and one no test of "does it hit" would catch.
