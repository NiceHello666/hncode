A cyan-blue terminal user interface (TUI) coding agent inspired by [Kimi Code](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code), with OpenAI + Anthropic support, an MCP-style toolbelt, and intelligent context management.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Cyan-blue TUI**: Raw terminal renderer for perfect Windows Terminal compatibility
- **Dual Protocol Support**: Works with both OpenAI-compatible APIs and Anthropic
- **Smart Context Management**: Auto-compaction at 85% usage, AI-summarized history retention
- **Prompt Caching**: Explicit cache breakpoints for the stable prefix (`/cache`)
- **MCP-style Toolbelt**: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, TodoList, WebSearch, etc.
- **MCP Client**: Connect real Model Context Protocol servers (stdio + HTTP) and use their tools
- **Skills**: Package reusable prompts as Markdown (`/import-skill`, `/skill:<name>` with tab-completion)
- **Shell Hooks**: Run your own commands at lifecycle events (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, …)
- **Git Workflow**: `/git`, `/commit`, `/branch`, `/worktree`, `/pr` plus a `Git` tool for the agent
- **Plan Review**: Review what a plan will touch, edit it, then approve before any file changes
- **Plugin System**: Extend with custom tools, commands, and hooks
- **Session Persistence**: Resume conversations across sessions
- **Permission Modes**: Ask, YOLO, or Auto modes for different workflows
- **Shell Passthrough**: type `!` on an empty prompt to switch the composer into shell mode — no model round-trip
- **CI / Scripting**: Headless `-p` with `json` / `stream-json` output and outcome-based exit codes
- **Remote Control**: `--control` exposes a local socket to prompt/status/interrupt a running session

### CI usage

```bash
# One prompt, machine-readable result, exit code reflects the outcome.
hncode -p "fix the failing tests" --output-format json
# -> {"type":"result","ok":true,"reply":"…","toolCalls":["Bash"],"files":["src/a.js"],…}

# Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 failure · 2 config · 3 no answer · 4 interrupted
hncode -p "run the linter and fix everything" --output-format stream-json | jq -c 'select(.type=="result")'
```

### Shell passthrough

Type `!` on an **empty** prompt to switch the composer into shell mode — the `!`
becomes the prompt symbol and the line runs directly, with no model involved:

```
! git add -A && git push
! npm test
```

The `!` is a mode marker, not part of what you type, so it appears exactly once.
Press `Esc` or `Backspace` on an empty line to leave the mode. Output appears in
the transcript as a `↳` receipt.

### Remote control

```bash
hncode --control                       # in one terminal (TUI)
hncode control status                  # in another
hncode control prompt "run the tests"  # queue a prompt on the running session
hncode control interrupt
```

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

hncode draws inspiration from several excellent projects:

- **[Kimi Code](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code)** - The original cyan-blue TUI coding agent that inspired this project's design and approach
- **[Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)** - The conversation flow and tool interaction patterns
- **[Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)** - Several behaviours were shaped by reading its open-source implementation: the AGENTS.md loading spec, the rule against spawning subagents unprompted, the plan-tool state machine, the review rubric, and parts of the system prompt

Special thanks to the communities behind these projects for pushing the boundaries of AI-assisted coding.
