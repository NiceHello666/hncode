// The team panel: who is on the team, what each is doing, and a composer to message them.
//
// WHY A PANEL AND NOT ONLY THE COMMAND
// ------------------------------------
// `/team msg alice ...` works, but a team is a thing you WATCH. The question a user has is "is
// anyone stuck, and who do I need to nudge" — and answering it from the command line means running
// `/team list`, reading four lines, and remembering them. The panel keeps the roster and each
// member's recent traffic on screen while you type.
//
// SHAPE
// -----
// Left: the roster, one line per member — name, live state, unread count. Below it a one-line
// composer. Enter sends to the selected member; Tab moves between members; Esc leaves.
//
// It follows tasks-browser.js: a pure renderer plus a key handler, so both are testable without a
// terminal.
