// A shared, bounded cache of rendered transcript rows.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// Wrapping and markdown-rendering a message is the expensive half of every frame, and the
// result depends only on (message text, width, colours) — so it is cacheable. The TUI
// already cached it, but on the message object itself, which makes the cache a property of
// the TRANSCRIPT rather than of the renderer:
//
//   * It was dropped by position, not by size. `CACHE_KEEP` counted messages from the
//     tail, so a 4000-message session threw away the caches of the 3700 oldest messages
//     while keeping the caches of 300 tiny ones — the window tracked message COUNT, not
//     memory. Scrolling back into a long session re-rendered from scratch every time.
//   * It could not survive a session switch, because it lived on messages that
//     `reconstructChat` throws away and rebuilds from the log. Every `--continue` and
//     every `/sessions` resume started with a cold cache, re-wrapping the whole
//     transcript before the first frame.
//   * It had two independent mechanisms — `m._cache` for the row list, `m._mdCache` for
//     the markdown blocks — with separate lifetimes and no bound between them.
//
// A `Map` keyed by a string, with entries ordered by use, fixes all three: the bound is
// real, the key survives any rebuild of the transcript, and both caches share one budget.
//
// THE KEY IS THE WHOLE POINT
// --------------------------
// A key that omitted a component of the layout would serve a row rendered for a different
// width or colour — which is not a stale cache, it is a MISDRAWN frame. So the key spells
// out everything the render depends on, and `makeRowKey` is the single place that decides
// what "the same" means. `evictIfStale` is the second half of the same contract: a streamed
// message's text grows every frame, so an entry whose text no longer matches is not a
// reuse, and the cache has to notice rather than serve it.

 *         is inserted or removed, which is exactly what compaction and /undo do.
 *   `text`  the content. Compared by VALUE, not by reference: a streamed message's
 *         `text` is replaced on every delta, and a reference check would miss every
 *         reuse after the first frame.
 *   `w`  the wrap width, `fg`/`codeFg` the colours, `expanded` the plugin-log toggle,
 *   `raw` the raw-mode flag, `pending`/`failed` the live-state flags, and `spin` the
