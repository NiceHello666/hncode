  description: 'Edit a file. THREE shapes:\n- LINE-RANGE mode: path + start_line + end_line + new_string. Replaces lines [start_line, end_line] with new_string.\nPREFERRED — use it whenever you have Read the file and know the line numbers.\n- EXACT-SUBSTRING mode: path + old_string + new_string. Replaces text exactly matching old_string. Use when the exact text is known and a line range is not convenient.\n- RANGED SUBSTRING mode: path + start_line + end_line + old_string + new_string. Searches for old_string ONLY inside [start_line, end_line], and replaces only what it finds there. Use this when the same snippet appears several times and you need exactly one of them: replace_all changes every copy, while plain substring mode refuses an ambiguous match. The range says WHERE to look, old_string says WHAT to replace.\nLEADING WHITESPACE — SPELL IT OUT ON EVERY LINE, INCLUDING THE FIRST. new_string is written VERBATIM in both modes: nothing is re-indented, auto-indented, or trimmed, and there is no tolerance for a missing first-line indent. Reproduce the indentation the code SHOULD have; it need not match the surrounding block. Copy it from the Read output, after its `N\\t` line-number prefix (Read prints `12\\t    return x`, so you send `    return x`).\nWRONG — nothing between the quote and `return`, so the line lands at column 0 inside an indented block. Look at the SHAPE as well: the quote touches the first character, and spaces only turn up after the first newline.\nnew_string: "return total;\n    total += 1;"\nRIGHT — four spaces, then `return`. The opening quote is followed by the indent as well, so every line carries its own indentation INCLUDING the first:\nnew_string: "    return total;\n    total += 1;"\nSame call, same words. The only difference is the spaces at the START of the first line, and that is the whole point — in the RIGHT form the indent sits between the quote and the code, exactly where it sits in the file you copied it from.\nThe same applies to tabs, and to a line whose indentation changes partway through.\nRANGE HYGIENE — WRITE ONLY THE LINES YOU ARE REPLACING. Lines [start_line, end_line] are deleted and new_string is inserted in their place, so a line you leave OUTSIDE that range survives — and if you also restated it inside new_string you get TWO copies. Check what sits on end_line + 1 before deciding where the range ends. In RANGED SUBSTRING mode this does not apply: only the snippet is replaced, not the whole range.\nWRONG — end_line: 3 deletes lines 2-3, but line 4 is repeated because its content was also written into new_string:\nnew_string: "const a = 1;\\nconst b = 20;\\nconst c = 3;"\nRIGHT — the range covers exactly what is being replaced, and nothing beyond it is restated:\nnew_string: "const a = 1;\\nconst b = 20;"\nTo touch line 4 as well, set end_line: 4 and include its new content in new_string.\nIn SUBSTRING and RANGED SUBSTRING modes old_string is matched EXACTLY, including the indentation of its own first line.\nOmitting new_string is an error, not an empty replacement.\nMis-indented lines often still parse, so a green test run is not proof that an edit landed correctly — re-Read the region before editing it again.\',',
