// WebSearch tool — Tavily's keyless search endpoint.
//
// WHY NOT THE PREVIOUS BACKEND
// ----------------------------
// puri.li/api/search answered, but it is a small crawler index, not a search engine: every hit reported
// `source: "crawled"`. Measured, `GitHub Actions` returned 677 documents and answered well, while
// `doutula 表情包` returned 6 — none about doutula — because that site is not in the index at all. A query
// with no real match still returned a full page of the documents that merely shared a word with it, and
// those were directory farms and unrelated pages.
//
// Tavily's keyless mode answers the same query with fabiaoqing.com, github.com/sunimp/doutula and
// huaban.com — pages that are actually about the site. That is the difference worth the change.
//
// WHY NOT A SCRAPED SEARCH PAGE
// -----------------------------
// This started as a Bing HTML scraper. It worked until the page still returned 200 with the query echoed
// in `<title>` but contained no results — the two or three `b_algo` blocks it did have were
// `translate.google.cn` and similar chrome. A scraper that returns junk does not look broken to the model:
// the results arrive in the normal shape, so they get used and cited.
