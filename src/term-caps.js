  // Terminal capability probing — ASK the terminal instead of guessing.
//
  // WHY THIS EXISTS
  // ---------------
  // Everything this app does that is terminal-specific used to be either unconditional
  // or env-var-gated. Three of those were guesses with real consequences:
//
  //   * `ESC[?2026h/l` (synchronized output) was wrapped around EVERY diff write. A
  //     terminal that does not implement it is supposed to ignore the private mode,
  //     but "supposed to" is doing a lot of work for two sequences per frame.
  //   * the Kitty keyboard protocol was turned ON by default with only
  //     `HNCODE_NO_KITTY_KEYS=1` to undo it, and the code's own comment admitted why
  //     that is a gamble: a terminal that does not implement `>1u` "reacts badly
  //     (dropped/mangled input)". That is a wrong-guess-causes-a-broken-keyboard bug.
  //   * the theme was forced to `dark`, whose normal text is WHITE, while the frame
  //     pads its rows with PLAIN SPACES — no background is ever painted. On a terminal
  //     with a light background that is white text on white: the transcript is
  //     invisible. Nothing in the process could tell, because nothing asked.
//
  // So this module asks. The protocol is the standard one, and it is worth spelling out
  // because it is why this needs no timeout-based guessing:
//
  //   Terminals process input sequentially and answer queries IN ORDER. So the batch
  //   ends with a Device Attributes request (`ESC[c`) — the one query every terminal
  //   answers — and its reply doubles as the end-of-batch sentinel: everything asked
  //   before it has been answered by the time it arrives. No per-query timeout, no
  //   waiting for absent replies.
//
  // A response arrives on the SAME stream as keystrokes, so whoever reads stdin while
  // the probe runs must route it here instead of into the key parser. `probeTerminal`
  // owns stdin for that window and hands back anything it could not consume, so a key
  // pressed during the probe is still delivered.
//
  // The whole thing is best-effort: an unanswered query leaves its field `null`, which
  // every consumer reads as "no information", never as "not supported".

/** How long to wait for the answers. Real terminals reply in ~1ms; this only bites
 *  on a terminal that answers nothing at all, where it is the price of not guessing. */
export const PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS = 250;

/** The batch, in the order it is written. DA1 is LAST — it is the sentinel.
 *    OSC 11 `?`          — report the background colour
 *    CSI ? u             — report the Kitty KEYBOARD protocol flags
 *    CSI ? 2026$p        — report whether synchronized output is known
 *    ESC _G ... ESC\    — query the Kitty GRAPHICS protocol: does it exist, and does it
 *                            accept the transmission format we would send
 *    CSI 16 t            — the pixel size of ONE CELL (XTWINOPS 16)
 *    CSI 14 t            — the pixel size of the TEXT AREA (XTWINOPS 14), a cross-check
 *                            for the cell size on a terminal that answers only that
 *    CSI c               — Device Attributes: the sentinel, and the VT level
 *
 *  Both query forms were wrong before, and both mattered only for images.
 *
 *  The graphics query is its own APC, not a `CSI ? u` variant — an earlier guess collided
 *  with the keyboard probe, and since an unanswered query is inferred as "not supported"
 *  once the sentinel arrives, that switched images OFF on the terminals that have them.
 *  It carries a REAL payload: one transparent RGBA pixel, RFC 1950 zlib, direct data
 *  (f=32, o=z) — the same path the renderer uploads on. A probe that asks about formats we
 *  would not send reports on a format we would not send. (dsh-TUI's terminal-querier.ts
 *  sends exactly this, with the same base64.)
 *
 *  The CELL size is XTWINOPS **16**, not 14: 14 is the text area. The reply to both is
 *  `CSI 6 ; w ; h t` — opcode 6 for the cell — so the parser matches on the REPORT
 *  opcode, and 14/18 were what an earlier version matched on and therefore never read.
