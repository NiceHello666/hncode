// The segmented context bar: used tokens by content type, then the remainder as one free
// segment whose right edge carries the usage readout.
//
// WHY A BAR AND NOT A NUMBER
// -------------------------
// `context: 12% (1.2k/97.7k)` says how full the window is and nothing about what filled
// it. The bar answers the question people actually have — "why is this getting full" — by
// making the composition readable: a session that grew from tool output looks different
// from one that grew from long answers, without reading a single figure.
//
// THE SHAPE OF THE ALLOCATION
// --------------------------
// Two passes, because plain rounding is wrong in both directions:
//
//   1. Every non-zero segment is guaranteed ONE column. Without this, a segment holding
//      0.3% of the window rounds to zero columns and disappears — and "thinking is a small
//      share" is exactly the fact a user is looking for.
//   2. The remaining columns are shared proportionally by LARGEST REMAINDER. Rounding each
//      share independently gives a total that is off by one or two, so the bar either falls
//      short of the row or overruns it.
//
// THE THREE-STEP LABEL
// -------------------
// Each segment says as much about itself as fits, because the segments are often only a
// few columns wide and there are three different things it could say:
//
//   1. `name + value` when the segment is wide enough for both — `ast 4.4k`
//   2. the name alone when only that fits — `ast`
//   3. nothing at all when not even the abbreviation does
//
// Steps 2 and 3 are not dead ends: every segment's columns are returned as a hit span, so
// pointing at one prints its full name and value in the row below the bar. That is why step
// 3 is acceptable — the information stays one pointer away.

 * therefore never reach the readout, at any fill level, and the readout is never truncated
 * into nonsense like `11.7k/97`.

 * @param {string} [readout] the caller's own wording, e.g. `context: 12% (11.7k/97.7k)`.
 *   Preferred over the derived one because it is what the status line already said; when the
