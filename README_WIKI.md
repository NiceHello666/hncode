## 1. What hncode is

hncode is a coding agent that lives in your terminal. You describe a task; it reads and edits files, runs shell commands, searches the codebase, fetches web pages, and keeps working until the task is done — subject to the permission mode you choose.

It is inspired by [Kimi Code](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code) and takes a similar approach: a raw-terminal (not `blessed`) cyan-blue TUI, a tool loop driven by a model that may emit tool calls, and streaming responses from either an OpenAI-compatible endpoint or Anthropic.

Key traits:

- **TUI, not CLI**: it is an interactive full-screen interface. It also has a non-interactive `-p` prompt mode for scripting.
- **Dual protocol**: OpenAI-compatible (`/chat/completions`) and Anthropic (`/messages`).
- **Zero runtime dependencies**: pure Node.js, no native modules, no third-party packages.
- **Model-agnostic**: anything that speaks the OpenAI or Anthropic wire format works.

---

## 2. Requirements

- **Node.js ≥ 20**
- A terminal. On Windows, **Windows Terminal** is recommended.
- An API key for at least one provider (OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic).

> **Windows note**: ideally also have [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) installed so tools that expect a POSIX shell can find `bash`.

---

## 3. Installation

### Global install (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @hncode/hncode
hncode
```

### Run without installing

```bash
npx @hncode/hncode
```

### The install hooks

The package declares two npm lifecycle scripts:

| Script | File | What it does |
|--------|------|--------------|
| `preinstall` | `bin/preinstall.js` | Checks Node ≥ 20, prints the platform, warns if already installed globally. |
| `install` | `bin/install.js` | Creates `~/.hncode/` with `config.toml`, `sessions/`, and `plugins/`, writes a starter config, then prints how to refresh your shell `PATH` on Windows / macOS / Linux. |

Neither script executes your code or phones home; they only create local directories and a default config file.

### Manual install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NiceHello666/hncode.git
cd hncode
npm link          # exposes the `hncode` command globally
```

---

## 4. First run

1. Launch `hncode`. On first run the install script has created `~/.hncode/config.toml`.
2. Add a provider **from inside the TUI**: run `/provider`, pick a known provider (or add a custom one), and paste your API key. Models are registered automatically. (If you already set `HNCODE_API_KEY`, this is unnecessary.)
3. Type your task and press **Enter**.

See [Configuration](#5-configuration) for the details.

The TUI is split into:

- **Transcript** (top): your messages, the model's answers, and each tool call with its result.
- **Todo panel**: appears when the agent is tracking tasks.
- **Composer** (bottom): where you type.
- **Status line**: model, permission mode, thinking effort, working directory.
- **Context line** (very bottom): live token usage / context window.

---

## 5. Configuration

hncode reads **only** `~/.hncode/config.toml` (plus `HNCODE_*` environment variables). It does not read any other product's config.

**You usually don't need to edit this file by hand.** Providers and models can be configured entirely from inside the TUI, and the resulting `config.toml` is written for you. Editing the TOML directly is an *advanced* option — useful for scripted setups, unusual endpoints, or settings the wizard does not expose.

### 5.1 Basic: configure everything from the TUI

Run these slash commands while hncode is open:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/provider` | Manage providers — **add**, **edit**, or **delete**. |
| `/model` | Pick a model, or switch between models you already added. |
| `/effort [off\|on\|high\|medium\|low]` | Set the thinking effort for the current model. |

**Adding a provider** (`/provider` → Add):

- pick a **known provider** from the [models.dev](https://models.dev) catalog — the base URL is pre-filled, or
- add a **custom provider** — you supply the name, base URL, API key, and protocol (`OpenAI` or `Anthropic`).

After you save it, hncode calls that provider's `/models` endpoint and **registers every model automatically**, recording each one's context window and thinking capability. You do not need to know any of that up front.

**Editing a provider** (`/provider` → Enter on a provider) lets you change its name, base URL, API key, and protocol type.

Everything is persisted to `~/.hncode/config.toml` immediately, so it survives a restart.

### 5.2 Advanced: edit `config.toml` by hand

`.hncode/config.toml` holds three things: top-level defaults, `[providers.*]`, and `[models.*]`.

A minimal file:

```toml
default_model = "gpt-4o-mini"

[providers.openai]
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."

[models.gpt-4o-mini]
provider = "openai"
model = "gpt-4o-mini"
```

**Providers** — `[providers.<name>]`:

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `base_url` | Base URL. hncode appends `/chat/completions` (OpenAI) or `/messages` (Anthropic). |
| `api_key` | API key for this provider. |
| `protocol` | `openai` (default) or `anthropic`. |

**Models** — `[models.<alias>]`:

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `provider` | Which provider this model belongs to. |
| `model` | The literal model id sent to the API. |
| `display_name` | Friendly name shown in the UI. |
| `context_length` | Context window in tokens (drives the context gauge). |
| `max_tokens` | Max output tokens. |
| `efforts` | Array of selectable thinking efforts, e.g. `["low","medium","high"]`. |
| `reasoning` | `true`/`false` — whether the model can think. |
| `always_thinking` | `true` if thinking cannot be turned off. |

After editing the file, run `/reload` to apply it without restarting.

### 5.3 Environment variables
Every value below **overrides** its `config.toml` counterpart — handy for CI or for keeping a key out of the file:

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `HNCODE_API_KEY` | API key. |
| `HNCODE_PROVIDER` | Provider name to use. |
| `HNCODE_MODEL` | Model alias to use. |
| `HNCODE_BASE_URL` | Override the base URL. |
| `HNCODE_PROTOCOL` | `openai` or `anthropic`. |
| `HNCODE_MAX_CONTEXT` | Override the context window size (tokens). |
| `HNCODE_MAX_OUTPUT` | Override the max output tokens per request. |
| `HNCODE_REASONING` | `1`/`true` to mark the model as reasoning-capable. |
| `HNCODE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` | Override the system prompt. |
| `HNCODE_CALM_MODE` | `1`/`true` to enable calm mode. |
| `HNCODE_ALLOW_EXTERNAL` | `1` to allow tool access to paths outside the workspace. |
| `HNCODE_CONFIG` | Path to an alternate config file (used by `doctor config`). |
| `HNCODE_SESSIONS_DIR` | Alternate directory for saved sessions. |
| `HNCODE_PLUGINS` | Alternate plugin directory. |
| `HNCODE_SKILLS_DIR` | Alternate skill directory. |
| `HNCODE_REPO` | Repository for `/skills install` and `/plugins install` (`owner/name`, default `NiceHello666/hncode`). |
| `HNCODE_REPO_REF` | Branch or tag to pull from (default `main`). |

---

## 6. Command-line interface

```
hncode [options] [command]
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-V, --version` | Print the version number. |
| `-S, --session [id]` | Resume a session (with an id, or pick interactively). |
| `-c, --continue` | Continue the most recent session **for the current directory**. |
| `-y, --yolo` | Ask-when-needed: workspace edits/commands run automatically; outside-workspace paths and destructive commands still ask. |
| `--auto` | Never ask: everything runs automatically. |
| `-m, --model <model>` | Model alias for this invocation. |
| `-p, --prompt <prompt>` | Run one prompt non-interactively and print the reply. |
| `--output-format <format>` | For prompt mode: `text` (default) or `stream-json`. |
| `--plan` | Start in plan mode (research only, no writes). |
| `--add-dir <dir>` | Add an extra workspace directory. Repeatable. |
| `-h, --help` | Show help. |

### Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `session list` | List sessions, most recent first. |
| `provider list` | Show configured providers and their model counts. |
| `doctor config [path]` | Validate a `config.toml`. |
| `init` | Create `~/.hncode/config.toml` with defaults. |
| `export [id]` | Export a session to `~/.hncode/export/<id>.json`. |

### Headless mode

```bash
hncode -p "explain what src/agent.js does"
hncode -p "list the TODOs" --output-format stream-json
```

In `stream-json` mode each event is printed as one JSON object per line, which is convenient for piping into other tools.

---

## 7. Slash commands

Type `/` in the composer to open the command menu; **Tab** completes, **Enter** runs.

### Session & workspace

| Command | Aliases | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/new` | `/clear` | Start a fresh session in the current workspace (clears the todo panel). |
| `/sessions` | `/resume` | Browse and resume past conversations **in this directory**. |
| `/fork` | — | Copy the current session into a new one without switching to it. |
| `/title <title>` | `/rename` | Set (or show) the session title; also sets the terminal window title. |
| `/move <path>` | — | Move the current session to another existing directory. |
| `/add-dir [list] \| <path>` | — | Add or list an extra workspace directory. |
| `/undo [count]` | — | Withdraw the last prompt(s) from the transcript. |
| `/init` | — | Analyze the codebase and generate `AGENTS.md`. |
| `/export-md [path]` | `/export` | Export the current session as a Markdown file. |
| `/import-session <file.md>` | `/import` | Attach a Markdown file to the prompt so the model reads it without a tool call. |

### Model & providers

| Command | Aliases | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/model <name>` | — | Switch model. `/model` alone opens a picker. |
| `/provider` | `/providers` | Add / edit / delete providers. |
| `/effort [off\|on\|high\|medium\|low]` | `/thinking` | Switch thinking effort. |
| `/logout` | `/disconnect` | Log out of a configured provider. |
| `/reload` | — | Reload `config.toml`. |

### Behaviour

| Command | Aliases | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/ask` | `/manual` | Always-ask mode. |
| `/yolo` | `/yes` | Ask-when-needed mode. |
| `/auto` | — | Never-ask mode. |
| `/plan [on\|off\|clear]` | — | Plan mode: research only, no writes. |
| `/focus [on\|off]` | — | Focus mode: start with a minimal tool subset. |
| `/calm-mode [on\|off]` | — | Terse replies; the model stops narrating. |
| `/set-system-prompt` | `/system-prompt` | Edit and save the system prompt (persisted to `config.toml`). |
| `/personal [global\|project]` | `/preferences` | Edit personal preferences injected into every prompt. `project` → `<workspace>/.hncode/PERSONAL.md` (this workspace), `global` → `~/.hncode/PERSONAL.md` (all workspaces). Bare `/personal` picks the scope. |
| `/goal [status\|pause\|resume\|cancel] \| <objective>` | `/objective` | Start or manage an autonomous goal. |

### Context & diagnostics

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/compact [ratio]` | Compact the conversation: AI-summarize the older part, keep the most recent 20% (or `1-ratio` if a ratio is given). |
| `/usage` | Show session tokens and the context window. |
| `/status` | Show session and runtime status. |
| `/tasks` | Browse background tasks. |
| `/mcp` | Show MCP server status. |
| `/mcp-config` | Configure MCP servers (list / add / remove). |
| `/plugins` | Open the plugin manager: loaded plugins, files on disk, and what the repo offers. `install <name>` / `remove <name>` skip the panel. |
| `/skills` | Open the skill manager (installed + available). `install <name>` / `remove <name>` skip the panel. |
| `/statusline` | Configure which items appear in the status line. |
| `/settings` | Open the settings menu (model / permission / statusline). |
| `/copy` | Copy the last assistant message to the clipboard. |
| `/help` | Show all commands and shortcuts. |
| `/version` | Show version information. |
| `/exit` | `/quit`, `/q` — exit. |

Unknown `/commands` are reported as errors and are **not** sent to the model.

---

## 8. Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Send the message. |
| `Shift+Enter` | Insert a newline in the composer. |
| `Ctrl-Shift-C` | Copy the current mouse selection (or the last answer if none). |
| `Ctrl-Shift-V` | Paste the clipboard. Multi-line pastes collapse into a `[paste #N +L lines]` marker. |
| `↑` / `↓` | With an empty composer: recall input history. Otherwise: scroll the chat. |
| `/` | Open the command menu; `Tab` cycles entries. |
| `↑` / `↓` | In a multi-line draft: move the caret between lines; at the first/last line: recall input history. With an empty composer: recall input history. |
| `Esc` | Cancel the menu/dialog, or interrupt the running turn. |
| `Ctrl-E` | Open `config.toml` in your editor. |
| `Ctrl-B` | Move the running Bash command to the background. |
| `Ctrl-S` | Steer queued input into the running turn. |
| `↑` (while queued) | Recall the last queued message for editing. |
| `Ctrl-O` | Expand/collapse tool output and thinking. |
| `Ctrl-T` | Expand/collapse the todo panel. |
| `Ctrl-C` twice | Exit hncode. |

### Pasting

- **Text** is inserted literally (multi-line collapses to a marker).
- **Files** are inserted as their absolute path(s), so the model can `Read` them.
- **Images** (e.g. a screenshot) are saved to a temp `.png` and the **path** is inserted.
- The clipboard is read on a **pre-warmed** background PowerShell, so repeats are ~10 ms instead of seconds.

### Mouse

- Drag to select transcript text; right-click for a Copy/Paste context menu.
- Drag the todo panel's top rule to resize it.
- Scroll with the wheel over the transcript or the `/` menu.

---

## 9. Tools

The model can call these built-in tools. Each returns a string; failures are shown in **red** and turn the tool's status bullet red.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Read` | Read a text file (whole file by default; `line_offset` / `n_lines` for a range). |
| `Write` | Write a file (create or overwrite). |
| `Edit` | Replace an exact `old_string` with `new_string` (must be unique unless `replace_all`). |
| `Bash` | Run a shell command; supports background jobs. |
| `Glob` | Find files by pattern. |
| `Grep` | Search file contents by regex. |
| `TodoList` | Maintain the task list shown in the todo panel. |
| `TaskList` / `TaskOutput` / `TaskStop` / `TaskWait` | Manage background tasks. |
| `FetchURL` | Fetch a URL and return its text. |
| `WebSearch` | Search the web. |
| `ReadMediaFile` | Read an image/media file. |
| `FileLines` | Count (or inspect) the lines of a file. |
| `AskUserQuestion` | Ask the user 1-4 multiple-choice questions mid-turn and wait for the answer. Every question also gets a free-text "Other" option, plus an optional notes row after the last one. If the user presses Esc the turn continues with no answer. |

Plugins can register more. A plugin installed from the repo does not register its tools
until the next start — see [Installing skills and plugins](#15-installing-skills-and-plugins-from-the-repo).

### The Edit safety model

`Edit` refuses to run blindly:

- The file must have been read in this session before it can be edited. Otherwise: `Edit rejected: you have not read the lines you are editing…`.
- If the file changed since you read it: `Edit rejected: <path> changed since it was Read…`. Re-read, then edit.

These guards prevent clobbering concurrent changes.

### How failures are shown

- **Bash**: a non-zero exit code turns the bullet red; the command's own output explains why.
- **Edit / Write**: the body is replaced by the diff, so on failure a red reason line appears beneath the tool call.
- **Read / Grep / Glob / …**: the full result is shown, in red when it failed.

---

## 10. Permission modes

| Mode | Command | Behaviour |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Always Ask** | `/ask` | Read-only tools run automatically; everything else asks first. |
| **Ask When Needed** | `/yolo` | Workspace edits/commands run automatically. Paths outside the workspace, destructive commands, questions, and plans still ask. |
| **Never Ask** | `/auto` | Nothing interrupts you; everything is decided automatically. The workspace path guard is lifted too, so the agent may read and write anywhere — this is the equivalent of `HNCODE_ALLOW_EXTERNAL=1` for the session. |

The mode is shown in the status line and is **persisted in the session**, so resuming restores it. CLI flags (`--auto`, `-y`) override it for that invocation.

Plan mode (`/plan`) restricts tools to read-only. Focus mode (`/focus`) starts with a minimal tool subset.

---

## 11. Context management & auto-compaction

Every request carries the conversation so far. When the estimated size reaches **85%** of the model's context window, hncode **auto-compacts**:

1. It keeps the most recent **20%** of messages.
2. It asks the model to **summarize** the older part (goals, decisions, files touched, current state).
3. The summary is inserted as a system message, so the conversation arc survives.

You can also compact manually:

```
/compact          # keep the last 20%, AI-summarize the rest
/compact 0.3      # drop the oldest 30%, keep 70%
```

Token usage is estimated as roughly 4 ASCII characters per token and 1 token per non-ASCII character. The live gauge at the bottom of the screen is refreshed every step.

---

## 12. Sessions

A session records `id`, `title`, `workspace`, `model`, `messages`, `rounds`, `steps`, and the runtime mode flags.

- Stored under `~/.hncode/sessions/<id>.json`.
- `/sessions` lists only sessions **from the current directory**.
- `hncode --continue` resumes the most recent session **for the current directory**.
- `/move <path>` relocates a session to another directory.
- `/new` starts a fresh one (and clears the todo panel).
- Mode flags (permission / plan / focus / effort) are persisted with the session.

---

## 13. Plugin system

A plugin is a single `.js`/`.mjs` file you drop into `~/.hncode/plugins/` (or the
directory named by `HNCODE_PLUGINS`). It is a normal ES module — no build step, no
manifest, no dependencies required. The file name is the plugin id.

### The smallest useful plugin

Save this as `~/.hncode/plugins/echo.mjs`, restart hncode, and the model gains a new
tool it can call:

```javascript
export function install(api) {
  api.registerTool({
    name: 'Echo',
    description: 'Echo the given text back. Use when the user asks to echo.',
    parameters: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: { text: { type: 'string', description: 'Text to echo.' } },
      required: ['text'],
    },
    async execute(args, ctx) {
      return args.text;
    },
  });
}

export default { name: 'echo', version: '1.0.0' };
```

Two things make it work:

- **`install(api)` is the entry point.** Export it by name, or as `default.install`.
  A file without it is skipped, with a message on stderr.
- **`export default` is metadata only** — `{ name, version }`, used by `/plugins`.
  Omit it and the plugin still works; it just shows up under its file name.

### Verify it loaded

`/plugins` lists everything that loaded, its version, and any commands it added:

```
Loaded plugins:
  • echo v1.0.0 (echo.mjs)
```

If your plugin is missing, the reason went to **stderr** — the TUI owns the screen,
so a load failure prints to the terminal rather than into the chat. A duplicate tool
or command name throws there too.

### Registering a slash command

```javascript
api.registerCommand({
  name: 'greet',              // becomes /greet
  aliases: ['hi'],
  description: 'Say hello.',
  argumentHint: '[name]',
  run: async (arg, ctx) => {
    // `arg` is everything typed after the command name.
    // Return a string to display it; return nothing for a no-op.
    return `Hello, ${arg || 'world'}!`;
  },
});
```

### Registering a hook

Hooks are how a plugin reacts to the agent loop. Every hook is optional, and each
receives plain data — a plugin never has to reach into internals.

| Hook | When it fires | Arguments |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| `onTurnStart` | A turn begins | `({ messages })` |
| `onBeforeRequest` | Just before the model call | `(messages, cfg)` |
| `onAfterRequest` | Just after the stream is consumed | `(messages, cfg)` |
| `onNewMessage` | An assistant message is committed to history | `(message, allMessages)` |
| `onToolExecute` | Before a tool runs | `(toolName, args, ctx)` |
| `onToolResult` | After a tool returns | `(toolName, result, ctx)` |
| `onTurnEnd` | The turn is over (also on interrupt) | `({ messages, stopped })` |

A practical example — audit every shell command the agent runs:

```javascript
export function install(api) {
  api.registerHook('onToolExecute', (name, args) => {
    if (name === 'Bash') console.error('[audit] bash:', args.command);
  });
}
```

Two guarantees worth relying on:

- **A throwing hook cannot break a turn.** Each hook runs inside a `try/catch`, the
  error is reported to stderr, and the agent continues.
- **Hooks run in registration order**, and may be async.

### Registering config defaults

`api.registerConfig({ ... })` merges values used by `resolveConfig`. They are applied
after the built-in defaults and **before** the user's `config.toml`, so the user
always wins.

### The full API surface

| Member | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `api.registerTool(spec)` | fn | Add a tool. Returns an unregister function. |
| `api.registerCommand(cmd)` | fn | Add a `/command`. Returns an unregister function. |
| `api.registerHook(name, fn)` | fn | Add a lifecycle hook. Returns an unregister function. |
| `api.registerConfig(defaults)` | fn | Merge default config values. |
| `api.ctx` | getter | The live agent context. Only meaningful inside a hook. |
| `api.tools` / `api.commands` / `api.hooks` / `api.config` / `api.plugins` | getter | Copies, for introspection. |
| `api.log` | obj | Report to the **chat**: `info`, `warn`, `error`, plus a `log` alias. |

All three `register*` functions return a function that undoes the registration, so a
plugin can unload itself:

```javascript
const off = api.registerTool({ /* … */ });
// later:
off();
```

### Reporting to the user

Use `api.log`, not `console`. The TUI owns the screen, so a `console.log` from a plugin
is written to a terminal the user cannot see while hncode is running. `api.log` puts the
message in the transcript, where they are already looking:

```javascript
export function install(api) {
  api.log.info('registered 3 tools');
  api.log.warn('the legacy option is ignored');
}
```

```
 • plugin: loaded my-plugin v1.0.0
 • plugin: registered 3 tools
 ! plugin: the legacy option is ignored
```

hncode reports its own plugin events the same way — a successful load, a plugin whose
`install()` threw, and a file with no `install()` export all appear as lines in the chat,
instead of only going to stderr. `api.log` still mirrors to the terminal, so a plugin
author watching stderr sees it too.

### Things that trip people up

- **Names must be unique across all plugins.** Registering `Echo` twice throws; two
  plugins cannot both claim the same tool or command name.
- **Plugins load once, at startup.** Editing a plugin file needs a restart.
  `/reload` reloads `config.toml`, not plugin code.
- **Use `api.log`, not `console`.** See above — the console is invisible while the TUI
  runs.
- **`api.ctx` is null outside a hook.** It is injected when the agent runs, so read it
  inside a hook callback rather than at install time.
- **A tool's `execute` must return a string.** That string is what the model sees.
  Throw instead, and the transcript shows `Error running <tool>: …`.
- **A plugin that throws during `install()` is NOT loaded.** Its tools never register, so
  it is reported as a failure and left out of `/plugins`, rather than being listed as
  loaded with nothing behind it.

## 14. Skills

A **skill** is a saved prompt fragment — a Markdown file you activate by name. Unlike a
plugin it contains no code: it is instructions, so it needs no restart and cannot break
the runtime.

```
/skill:review-pr make sure the error paths are covered
```

Typing `/skill:` opens a completion menu of installed skills. Whatever follows the name
is appended to the skill body and sent as the prompt, so the skill sets the approach and
your text is the specific ask.

### Activating a skill

The transcript shows an activation card, not your slash command:

```
▶ Activated skill: review-pr
  make sure the error paths are covered
```

The skill body is injected as a **system** message, so it shapes the model's behaviour
without ever appearing as something you said. One consequence worth knowing: a bare
`/skill:name` with no text sends **no user message at all** — the skill body is the whole
instruction. If you want to ask something specific, type it after the name.

### Where skills live

| Location | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| `~/.hncode/skills/<name>.md` | Every workspace. |
| `<workspace>/.hncode/skills/<name>.md` | This workspace only. |

The file name is the skill name: `review-pr.md` is activated as `/skill:review-pr`.

Optional YAML front-matter supplies the name and the description shown in `/skills`:

```markdown
---
name: review-pr
description: Review a pull request for the bugs that actually ship
---

Read the diff, then check…
```

The body is everything after the closing `---`. Front-matter is optional — without it the
whole file is the body and the name comes from the file name.

### Managing skills

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/skills` | Open the skill manager (see the next section). |
| `/skills install <name>` | Download one from the repo, without opening the panel. |
| `/skills remove <name>` | Delete the local copy. |
| `/import-skill <file.md> [name]` | Copy a Markdown file from disk into the skills directory. |

```
/skills            # the manager
/skills install root-cause
/import-skill ./my-notes.md release-checklist
```

## 15. Installing skills and plugins from the repo

hncode ships **no** skills or plugins in the npm package. They are fetched on demand from
the project repository, which keeps the installed package small and lets a skill be
updated without a release.

The repository holds one directory per item:

```
skills/<name>/SKILL.md      ->  ~/.hncode/skills/<name>.md
plugins/<name>/index.js     ->  ~/.hncode/plugins/<name>/index.js
```

### The manager

`/skills` and `/plugins` (bare, or with `list`) open a full-screen manager:

```
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 Plugins
 Tab switch · ↑↓ select · Enter install/remove · Esc close

 [Loaded (1)]  On disk (2)   Available (3)

 ❯ my-plugin/                     restart
     not loaded — restart hncode to load it
   secret-guard                   installed
     Catch credentials before they are written

 Enter removes the local copy of my-plugin
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

- **Tab** switches tabs; **↑/↓** move; **Enter** installs or removes; **Esc** closes;
  **r** refetches.
- Every row carries a **description** so you can tell what you are installing.
- The tabs mean different things, which is why there are three for plugins:
  - **Loaded** — plugins running in this session.
  - **On disk** — files in `~/.hncode/plugins`, loaded or not. An entry here that is not
    in Loaded needs a **restart**.
  - **Available** — what the repo offers, badged `installed` when you already have it.
- Skills have two tabs: **Installed** and **Available**.

Installing over an existing entry is allowed and reported as an *update* — that is how you
pick up a newer version.

### What the buttons do

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Install (skill) | Downloads `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` to `~/.hncode/skills/<name>.md`. Usable immediately. |
| Install (plugin) | Downloads `plugins/<name>/*` to `~/.hncode/plugins/<name>/`. **Restart to load.** |
| Remove | Deletes the local copy. A running plugin stays loaded until you restart. |

### Notes

- **The list is fetched live**, with no cache, so a skill merged five minutes ago appears
  on the next open. If the fetch fails, only the **Available** tab says so — the local
  tabs keep working, because they read the filesystem.
- Only loadable files are downloaded for a plugin (`.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.json`, `.md`),
  so a stray asset in a plugin directory cannot land in your plugin folder.
- A skill directory **must** contain `SKILL.md`. Without it the entry is listed as
  uninstallable rather than producing a nameless skill.
- Installing verifies the name first: anything with `/`, `\`, or a leading `.` is refused.
- Set `HNCODE_REPO` / `HNCODE_REPO_REF` to point at a fork (defaults:
  `NiceHello666/hncode` @ `main`).
- **On GitHub rate limits**: the listing uses the unauthenticated GitHub API, which allows
  60 requests/hour per IP. Opening `/skills` costs one request plus one per skill (to read
  each description), so a very large repo can hit the limit — the panel then says so and
  the local tabs keep working.

### Contributing one

Add `skills/<your-skill>/SKILL.md` or `plugins/<your-plugin>/index.js` and open a PR. The
directory name becomes the install name, so keep it to plain words. See the `README.md` in
each directory for the full convention.

These files are **not** published to npm — `package.json` whitelists only `bin/`, `src/`
and the top-level docs.

## 16. For developers

### Project layout

```
bin/            CLI entry points (hncode, .cmd, .ps1) + install hooks
src/
  index.js      argv parsing, subcommands, headless mode, TUI dispatch
  tui.js        the raw-TTY renderer, key handling, slash commands
  agent.js      the tool loop (request → tool calls → repeat)
  llm.js        OpenAI + Anthropic client (streaming & non-streaming)
  config.js     config.toml resolution, providers, models, thinking effort
  session.js    session store
  plugin.js     plugin host + registry
  tools/        one file per tool
  colors.js     ANSI colour helpers
  term.js       token estimation, width math, wrapping
```

### The agent loop

`src/agent.js` runs: build the request → stream the reply → if the model emitted tool calls, execute them and append the results → repeat, until the model answers without tool calls, the user interrupts, or the step budget (if any) runs out. A completion guard nudges the model if it stops mid-task (up to `MAX_NUDGES` times).

### Adding a tool

1. Create `src/tools/mytool.js` exporting a `spec` with `name`, `description`, `parameters` (JSON schema), and `async execute(args, ctx)`.
2. Register it in `src/tools/index.js`.

### Token estimation

`estimateTokens(text)` in `src/term.js`: ASCII counts ~4 chars/token, non-ASCII ~1 char/token.

### Running the test suite / checks

There is no test runner wired up; keep `node --check <file>` clean and exercise changes manually.

## 17. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---------|--------------------|
| `hncode: interactive mode requires a TTY` | You are piping output. Use `hncode -p \"…\"` for non-interactive use. |
| `no api_key configured` | Set `HNCODE_API_KEY`, or configure a provider (`/provider`). Run `hncode doctor config`. |
| Commands look garbled on Windows | Use **[Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)**; legacy `cmd.exe` consoles render poorly. It is free on the Microsoft Store, and hncode's renderer is built for it. |
| Paste feels slow | It should be ~10 ms after the first paste (the clipboard helper is pre-warmed). A very slow first paste is the PowerShell cold start. |
| `Edit rejected: you have not read the lines…` | `Read` the file (the relevant lines) first, then `Edit`. |
| Context gauge near 100% | Run `/compact`, or let auto-compaction trigger at 85%. |
| A plugin I wrote does not load | The reason is on **stderr**, not in the chat — the TUI owns the screen. Run hncode, quit, and read the terminal output. The name must be unique, and a directory plugin needs an `index.js`. |
| `/plugins` says the list could not be fetched | GitHub was unreachable, or you hit the unauthenticated API rate limit (60/hour). The **Loaded** and **On disk** tabs are unaffected — they read the filesystem. |
| An installed plugin is in **On disk** but not **Loaded** | Plugins load at startup only. Restart hncode. |
| `/skills install` says there is no `SKILL.md` | The repo entry is malformed: every skill directory must contain `SKILL.md`. |

## 18. Acknowledgments

hncode is built on the ideas of several open-source projects:

- **[Kimi Code](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code)** — the cyan-blue raw-terminal TUI and the overall agent shape that this project follows.
- **[Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)** — conversation flow and tool-interaction patterns.
- **[Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)** — reading its open-source implementation shaped several behaviours here: the `AGENTS.md` loading spec (scope, precedence, injection), the rule against spawning subagents without explicit permission, the plan-tool state machine, the code-review finding filter, and parts of the system prompt.
